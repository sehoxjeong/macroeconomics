# Macroeconomics

> [!WARNING]
> Work in progress!

Welcome to my **"macroeconomics"** repository!

This repository contains notes and codes on macroeconomics.

All errors are my own.

## Contents

This repository is mainly divided into two parts: `notes` and `codes`.

- `notes` include course notes on various topics in macroeconomic theory.
- `codes` include programming codes that solve various macroeconomic models.
- `python` includes jupyter notebook files on basic Python syntax.
- `julia` includes jupyter notebook files on basic Julia syntax.

### Notes
